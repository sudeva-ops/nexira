# NEXIRA · Pilot modules: requirements · v0.1

For the product owner, who approves this document; then for the coding agent, which builds from `docs/prompts-pilot.md`. It adds to `docs/requirements.md` (the Phase 1 PRD) and follows `docs/decisions.md`, in particular D-30 (pilot scope) and D-31 (Mass Notification rules).

**Status:** Mass Notification was **approved by the product owner on 2026-10-25** (PR #16), with the defaults for the questions in §8. The other pilot modules are only outlined (§7). Each will be written and approved before it is built.

---

## 1. Purpose

Phase 1 (Prompts 0–16) is complete: the core loop on simulated data, with the Nairobi acceptance scenario passing. The pilot adds the modules in D-30 that can be shown on simulated data, starting with Mass Notification:
- It is the smallest of them, because the campaign and delivery engine already exists.
- It completes the "Essentials" packaging tier (master spec §2.4, and decisions.md §9 item 7).
- Its per-mission templates fix a known demo limitation: today the PB-07 citizen advisory text names Nairobi, even for an incident in Paris.

## 2. What already exists (no work needed)

| Capability | Where |
|---|---|
| Campaigns and deliveries, with NTF references | `notification_campaign`, `notification_delivery`, `backend/app/modules/notifications/service.py` |
| Statuses `DRAFT`, `SENDING`, `SENT`, `CANCELLED`; `created_by_type` `USER`; `incident_id` optional; type `TEST` | schema v0.2 (the API does not use them yet) |
| Five channels (APP, SMS, WHATSAPP, VOICE, EMAIL) through the simulated adapter only | `notifications/channels.py` (CHK-04, D-29) |
| Delivery states QUEUED → SENT → DELIVERED → READ / FAILED, the outbox dispatcher and idempotency | `notifications/consumer.py` |
| Approvals with roles, mission scope and one person per step | `app/core/approvals.py` (D-05, D-16) |
| Read-only campaign list and detail API | `GET /api/campaigns`, `GET /api/campaigns/{id}` |

## 3. Requirements: Mass Notification (MN)

Priority: M = Must, S = Should. The "Master" column gives the master spec ID each requirement implements.

| ID | Requirement | Master | Pri. | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| MN-01 | **Compose** a campaign: kind (ALERT, ADVISORY, CHECKIN), message, channels, audience, optional incident. It is saved as a DRAFT and can be edited until it is sent. | NTF-01 | M | A Duty Officer creates a draft. Its NTF reference is allocated at creation (D-18). Editing it changes nothing in `notification_delivery`. |
| MN-02 | **Audiences:** by mission (one or more), by person type (staff, delegates, dependants, contractors, citizens), and "exposed to incident X". The recipient count and the split by person type are shown before sending. | NTF-01 | M | The preview for "NBO, citizens" shows 212. The preview for "exposed to INC-…-1042" shows 229 (D-23). |
| MN-03 | **Templates** per mission and kind, with a generic fallback. A template holds EN and pre-written translations, each marked reviewed or not (D-15). A template fills the message, and the user may edit the result. | NTF-01, NTF-03 | M | Choosing "Civil unrest: shelter in place" for a Paris campaign gives Paris text, not Nairobi text. With no Paris template, it gives the generic text with the mission's city. |
| MN-04 | **PB-07 and the Communications agent use the templates.** The advisory comes from the incident mission's template, so no advisory text is fixed in the playbook seed. | — | M | In the France scenario, the advisory proposed for Paris contains no "Nairobi", "CBD" or "Upper Hill". The Nairobi acceptance scenario is unchanged. |
| MN-05 | **Second person for citizens** (D-31). If the audience includes citizens, the campaign goes to *pending approval*. It is sent only when a different user with `DUTY_OFFICER\|CONSULAR_OFFICER` approves it, through `approvals.decide`. A staff-only campaign can be sent by its author, if the author holds `DUTY_OFFICER\|SECURITY_OFFICER`. | NTF-01, AGR-04 | M | The author's own approval is refused (403). A Viewer cannot approve. A second Duty Officer approves, and the deliveries are queued. |
| MN-06 | **Unreviewed translations block sending in a pilot.** With `APP_ENV=pilot`, a campaign with an unreviewed translation cannot be sent; the user removes that language or uses a reviewed text. Local and demo keep today's behaviour, with the marker shown. | NTF-03, D-15 | M | Pilot mode: 409 with the language named. Demo mode: it is sent with `[REVIEW REQUIRED]`. |
| MN-07 | **Cancel** a draft or a campaign pending approval. A sent campaign cannot be cancelled. | NTF-05 | M | Cancel → CANCELLED, audited; no deliveries. |
| MN-08 | **Test send to self.** It renders the message as each chosen channel would show it, in the phone preview panel. It creates no deliveries, and it writes an audit row. | NTF-05 | M | The audit row shows `CAMPAIGN.TEST_SEND`; the delivery count is unchanged. |
| MN-09 | **Delivery funnel** for each campaign and channel: queued, sent, delivered, read, failed. It updates live over the WebSocket. | NTF-04 | M | During the simulated sending, the counts move without a page reload. |
| MN-10 | **Campaign history:** a list of all campaigns (from playbooks, agents and users) with filters for kind, status, mission and incident, and who created and approved each one. | NTF-05 | M | The list shows the PB-07 check-in and the advisory from the Nairobi scenario next to composed campaigns. |
| MN-11 | **Channel fallback (simulated):** when a delivery FAILS on a channel, the next channel in the campaign's order is tried for that person, once. The simulated adapter can fail a configurable share of deliveries, in demo only. | NTF-02 | S | With a 10 % SMS failure rate, the failed people receive an EMAIL delivery, and the funnel shows both. |
| MN-12 | **Everything audited:** create, edit, submit, approve, reject, cancel, test send and send. Each audit row records the user, and the audit chain still verifies. | PLT, D-20 | M | `GET /api/audit/verify` is intact after the e2e test. |

### Not in this module
- Real SMS, email, WhatsApp or voice delivery: channels stay simulated (D-30).
- Machine translation: D-15 still applies; this waits for the local model.
- Scheduled sends, recurring campaigns, and replies from recipients other than check-in answers.

## 4. Roles

| Action | Roles |
|---|---|
| Read campaigns | All Phase 1 roles (as today) |
| Compose, edit, cancel, test send | `DUTY_OFFICER`, `SECURITY_OFFICER`, `CONSULAR_OFFICER`, `ADMIN` |
| Send to staff and delegates only | the author, holding `DUTY_OFFICER\|SECURITY_OFFICER` |
| Approve a campaign that reaches citizens | a different user, holding `DUTY_OFFICER\|CONSULAR_OFFICER` |
| Manage templates and mark translations reviewed | `ADMIN`, `CONSULAR_OFFICER` |

Mission scope works as in D-05. A Head of Mission sees and approves only within their mission's campaigns, but is not an approver by default.

## 5. Data changes

These are proposed in `docs/schema/proposed-changes.md` and need approval before the migration is written:
- **PC-07 · `message_template`:** a new tenant table for templates per mission and kind, with RLS and grants. It is a 🔒 change (D-29).
- **PC-08 · `notification_campaign` columns for approval:**
  - a `PENDING_APPROVAL` status;
  - `submitted_by`, `approved_by`, `approved_at`, `template_id`;
  - a trigger that refuses `approved_by = created_by`, as a database backstop for MN-05.

## 6. Acceptance for the module

An end-to-end test (Playwright, real stack):
1. A Duty Officer composes an advisory for the Paris mission's citizens from a template, test-sends it to themselves, and submits it.
2. The same user cannot approve it.
3. A second Duty Officer approves it. The deliveries are queued, and the funnel reaches *read* for every person.
4. The audit chain verifies at the end.

The Nairobi acceptance scenario and the France scenario still pass. The France scenario's advisory now names Paris.

## 7. Next modules (outline only; to be written before they are built)

| Module | Starting point | Needs to be decided |
|---|---|---|
| Journey Management (JRN-01..05) | `trip`, `trip_traveller` and trip exposure already exist | trip approval thresholds; the Travel Desk role in the pilot; checklist content |
| Air Travel Tracking (AIR-01..07) | nothing | a simulated flight model; AIR-06 (never show VIP movements) before any real feed |
| Travel & Air agent | the agent framework | action policies for diversion and rebooking (level 2, Travel Desk) |
| Assistance Partners (AST-01..04) | nothing | only if the pilot customer wants it |

## 8. Questions answered by the product owner (2026-10-25)

1. **Second person:** for campaigns that reach citizens only (MN-05 as written). Size alone does not trigger it.
2. **Templates:** maintained by `ADMIN` and `CONSULAR_OFFICER` (§4 as written).
3. **Channel fallback (MN-11):** wanted in the pilot, on the simulated adapter, as a Should.
